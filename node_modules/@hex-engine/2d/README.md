This package expands on [`@hex-engine/core`](http://npm.im/@hex-engine/core) to provide primitives for making a 2D game in [Hex Engine](https://github.com/suchipi/hex-engine).

It includes:

- An HTML5 Canvas-based renderer
- `useUpdate` and `useDraw` hooks
- Support for sprite sheets and animations
- Components that make it easy to work with [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and [BMFont](https://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) assets
- Components that make it easy to work with mouse, keyboard, and gamepad input
- Components for a 2D Physics Engine ([matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/))
- Components and hooks for working with the Web Audio context and generating procedural sound via [modal-synthesis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modal-synthesis)
- And much, much more
