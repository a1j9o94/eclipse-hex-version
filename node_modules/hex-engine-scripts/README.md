# `hex-engine-scripts`

This package provides a CLI for your [Hex Engine](https://github.com/suchipi/hex-engine) game that can do the following:

- Run a development server
- Make a production build of your code for distribution
- Run your tests

It's automatically installed and set up when you use [`create-hex-engine-game`](https://github.com/suchipi/hex-engine/tree/master/packages/create).

## Prior Work / Thanks

`hex-engine-scripts` is heavily inspired by, and uses some code from, [`react-scripts`](http://npm.im/react-scripts).
